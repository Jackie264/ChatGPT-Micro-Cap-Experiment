# Thesis Review Summary

Going into Week 17, our portfolio is now a concentrated bet on three high-impact catalysts:

---

### 1. Milestone Pharmaceuticals (MIST)

**Thesis:** A pure FDA binary play. MIST is awaiting a Dec 13 FDA decision on its PSVT therapy, which, if positive, could be transformational for the company and our portfolio.  

We’ve kept MIST as our largest holding because:  
(a) we have strong conviction from due diligence that the drug’s prior issues have been resolved, and  
(b) the payoff could be game-changing (multi-bagger potential).  

We accept the binary risk here, buffered by a stop-loss to guard against total collapse. In essence, MIST is our “home run” swing to catch up to the S&P – as of now, nothing has derailed this thesis.  

We expect increasing attention on MIST as the PDUFA date nears, which could itself lift the stock price in anticipation.

### 2. Aytu BioPharma (AYTU)

**Thesis:** An undervalued commercial story about to unfold.  

Aytu is launching **EXXUA**, the first new-class antidepressant in years, targeting a huge market with unmet needs (notably, EXXUA doesn’t have the sexual side effects common to SSRIs).  

The market seems to be in “wait and see” mode – the stock is still tiny – which gives us a chance to get in early. Our bet is that as launch news trickles out (formulary placements, prescription numbers, etc.), investors will re-rate Aytu upwards.  

With backing from reputable healthcare investors and the company’s own commercialization experience, execution risk is moderated (though not eliminated).  

By the experiment’s end (late Dec), we should have at least initial signals of how EXXUA is being received. Even a small market penetration could justify a market cap many times the current $23M.  

Our stop at **$1.80** protects us if the market loses confidence (e.g., if launch is delayed or initial uptake is poor).  

But our baseline expectation is that AYTU’s stock will trend upward through Q4 as EXXUA hits the market – making this a timely entry.

### 3. Microbot Medical (MBOT)

**Thesis:** Riding the momentum of a breakthrough device approval.  

Microbot’s **LIBERTY** robotic system clearance is a big deal in medtech – it’s literally the first of its kind (remotely-operated, single-use robot).  

Such a novelty could see rapid adoption if marketed well, because it addresses real needs (reducing physician radiation exposure, improving access to advanced procedures in more settings).  

We believe the next few weeks will bring increased visibility: MBOT management is actively promoting the device (conferences, investor events) and preparing for a Q4 commercial launch.  

Any concrete progress (first sale, hospital interest, partnership) could spike the stock. Even absent that, the “hype cycle” for a cleared device may continue – sometimes these stocks run up into the launch just on optimism.  

We’ve seen a slight pullback which we used to initiate our position; now we will watch for a reversal upward.  

Downside risks include the company possibly needing additional capital next year for full commercialization – but near-term, they already signaled accelerated launch plans with existing resources.  

Our stop at **$2.30** is there in case the stock unexpectedly fades (which would imply the catalyst hype is over or delayed).  

However, we anticipate positive news flow. In summary, MBOT is our play on an innovative tech adoption story, which complements the drug stories in our portfolio.

### Why this portfolio now?

After this rebalance, we’ve essentially doubled down on “catalyst acceleration.”  
All three positions have events in Q4 2025 that can drastically move their stock prices.  

This is a conscious pivot from a more diversified approach to a focused one – we recognize that, with only ~10 weeks left, incremental gains won’t catch up a >20% deficit versus the S&P.  

We need one or two big wins. MIST, AYTU, and MBOT each have the capacity to possibly double (or more) on good outcomes.  

Importantly, they are independent events (an FDA approval, a product launch, and a device commercialization), so the success of one is not inherently correlated with the others. This gives us three “shots on goal.”  

We’ve also set protective stops to limit the damage if any single thesis fails.

### The coming week

We’ll be watching for initial feedback:

- Does the market start pricing in EXXUA’s launch (AYTU climbing)?
- Do we hear anything from Microbot’s conference presentations (any buzz from the medical community)?
- Does MIST remain steady or start creeping up on no news (which could indicate speculative buying ahead of FDA)?

We will review these questions in the next update.  

Overall, the portfolio is high-risk, but it’s a calculated risk aligned with our mandate to seek alpha. Every position has a clear catalyst and defined exit strategy.  

We’ve rotated out of slower plays (**SPRO, TLSA**) to ensure every dollar is working hard toward our year-end goal.  

Now it’s about diligent monitoring and risk management as we let these theses play out.

### Next Week’s Outlook

Expect potentially more volatility, but also the chance for news-driven upside.  

We will report on any material developments and will be ready to adjust if needed.  

The focus is now on **execution** – both by our companies (launching and delivering on their catalysts) and by us (responding swiftly to market movements).  

We are entering the “make or break” phase of the experiment with a portfolio tailored for exactly that.
